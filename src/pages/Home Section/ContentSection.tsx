        Hourly Hotel Stays in Bhubaneswar – Flexible, Affordable & Comfortable
      </Typography>

      <Typography paragraph>
        Hourly hotel stays in Bhubaneswar are becoming the preferred choice for
        travelers who need flexibility, privacy, and affordability. Unlike
        traditional overnight hotel bookings, hourly stays allow you to pay
        only for the time you use. Whether you are visiting the city for a few
        hours, waiting for a connecting journey, attending meetings, or simply
        need a comfortable place to relax, hourly hotels offer a smart and
        budget-friendly solution.

      <Typography paragraph>
        Bhubaneswar, known as the Temple City of India, attracts business

        privacy, or passengers with long layovers.
